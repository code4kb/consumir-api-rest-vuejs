## Starting üöÄ

These instructions will allow you to obtain a copy of the running project on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

Before starting to clone the project, I must tell you that it is already configured by WebPack, so you should not worry.

### Pre requirements üìã

First of all, make sure you have all the prerequisites installed:

- [Download Node.js and npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (npm is distributed along with Node.js, which means that when you download Node.js, npm is automatically installed on your computer)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/).

After verifying the prerequisites, we can proceed with the installation.

### Installation üîß

**Paso 2:**  Package installation

After cloning, we access the directory we just created and install all the dependencies of the project. Write this command in your terminal
